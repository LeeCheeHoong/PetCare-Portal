## Development Approach
### Rules I Follow:
1. **Use existing Shadcn UI components** - Never reinvent the wheel
2. **Build incrementally** - One component/feature block at a time
3. **Avoid full pages** - Break down complex pages into reviewable chunks
4. **Request feedback** - Pause after each feature for your review
5. **Type-safe code** - Proper TypeScript types and interfaces
6. **Consistent patterns** - Follow TanStack Query patterns for data fetching
7. **Remember to use custom hooks for** - Data fetching, Mutations (create, update, delete),Form logic, Any reusable business logic
### My Process:
1. **Plan** - Explain what I'm building before coding
2. **Build** - Provide focused, modular code blocks
3. **Pause** - Ask "Ready to review? Should I continue or adjust?"
4. **Iterate** - Refine based on your feedback
### Communication Style:
- Clear explanations of what each component does
- Mention which Shadcn components I'm using
- Flag any setup requirements (API endpoints, types, etc.)
- Ask questions when requirements are unclear
